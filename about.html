            Biruk: The Journey of a Self-Made Web Developer
            Hello! My name is Biruk, and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at Addis Ababa University. From a young age, I've been captivated by the world of technology, spending countless hours exploring how websites work. What began as a hobby has grown into a passion and a promising career.
            
            My Journey
            Growing up in Addis Ababa, I was the kid who was always tinkering with computers. While my friends played soccer, I was more interested in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By the time I graduated high school, I had already built several websites for friends and local businesses, setting the stage for my future in web development.
            
            University Life
            At Addis Ababa University, I immerse myself in every opportunity to learn and grow. My coursework in Software Engineering provides a solid foundation, while tech clubs and coding bootcamps allow me to apply and expand my skills. I'm fortunate to have supportive professors who encourage me to push my boundaries.
            
            Real-World Experience
            Despite a busy academic schedule, I dedicate my evenings and weekends to web development. I take on freelance projects, helping small businesses and individuals create stunning, functional websites. From e-commerce platforms to personal blogs, each project is a chance to learn and innovate.
            
            Highlights
            Freelance Projects: Developed a portfolio site for an art student, an online booking system for a local restaurant, and an e-commerce website for a small business.
            Startup Collaboration: Currently working part-time with a startup in Nairobi, helping them launch a new product while continuing my studies.
            Tech Community: Active member of university tech clubs, participating in seminars and tech events to share my journey and inspire others.
            SamTech Solutions
            To formalize my freelance work, I launched SamTech Solutions, my web development business. Offering services from simple websites to complex web applications, SamTech Solutions quickly gained traction, attracting clients from Ethiopia and beyond.
            
            Looking Ahead
            Balancing work and studies has taught me the importance of time management, prioritization, and setting realistic goals. My journey from a curious child to a successful web developer at Addis Ababa University is just the beginning. I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges, ready to apply my skills to the next big project.
